you can run the code that reads a table from an url. There is also a file to run this from a downloaded .txt file in case the site is down

```{r}
url = 'ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt'
co2 = read.table(url, col.names = c("year", "month", "decimal_date",
                                    "monthly_average", "deseasonalized",
                                    "n_days", "st_dev_days",
                                    "monthly_mean_uncertainty"))
head(co2)
```
